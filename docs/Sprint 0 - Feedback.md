Combined Grade: 97

## Planning Document Feedback (Group): 

- Great system description. You could almost use this 'as is' for your Rhodes Symposium abstract.
- Your architectural overview is a good start, but there is something missing related to the analytics piece. What is inserting the 'prediction results' into the database? Don't you need some other system component for this?
- Overall, your epics are very good; however, some of them are only partial user stories (e.g., missing the 'reasons' for doing the work -  'As a... I want... so that').
- Your 2nd epic requires access to 'class difficulty'. It's still not clear to me how you are planning to get that data.
- Great non- functional requirements.
- Your technologies list is a start, but I think you should also reference something related to your predictive model. What technologies are needed there? You also should split up database (SQLite) from your web framework (Django). Also, you may need to eventually do something with HTML, CSS, and Javascript.
- Your MVP is very reasonable.
- Your roadmap is not bad, but its a little unclear because you structure some of it around individual architectural components (model, view, template) rather than implemented features. If you are driving your development from user stories, you should get tangible 'value' from your development activities (tasks). Until Sprint 3, its not clear what tangible value you will have to show. If you had something like 'Visualize historical enrollment data on web page' for Sprint 2, then it would be clear that you are targetting something that is part of your core, needed functionality. 'Implement business logic in views' is very vague. (Business logic also sounds more like a modelly thing.)

## Requirements Feedback (Group): 

- Extremely good user stories!
- Your titles are consistently formatted and easy to understand.
- All of your stories are traceable to epics.
- You have acceptance criteria for every story, and they are really good!
- You've figured out estimates for all of your stories, which is wonderful. You do have a lot of high stories, so you may want to look for opportunities to break those up into smaller, more manageable stories.
- It looks like you've done some prioritization. It's a little hard to connect all of them to your roadmap and MVP, but what I can figure out seems consistent.
- Overall, incredible job! Well done!
